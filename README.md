Emoji Memory Match is a delightful game that challenges your mind and tickles your fancy. With its colorful emojis and simple gameplay, it's a perfect way to pass the time and exercise your brain. This project is a simple Emoji Memory Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a focus on DOM manipulation.

### How to Play:
